# Week Two, Day One: Monday (7/12/21)
Using the regression script from class and the Auto Imports dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, specify and train both a multi-class linear regression and a multi-class DNN regression. 

1. *Which of the two models produces a better loss metric? Produce a plot that supports your answer.*
2. *Add additional continuous and categorical features with the intent of improving your loss metric. What is the best model you can produce?*
