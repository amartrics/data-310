# Week One, Day Two: Wednesday (7/8/2021)  

Start with the *Basic classification: Classify images of clothing* script that you prepared for class. Consider the following questions as you execute the code. 
1. *From the Preprocess the data section of the script, modify the training image to produce three new images.*

2. *Under the Make predictions section, present the array of predictions for an image from the test set other than the one given in the example script.* 
      a) *What does this array represent?*
      b) *How were the Softmax() and argmax() functions applied?*
      c) *Does the output from np.argmax() match the label from your test_labels dataset?* 
3. *Under the Verify predictions section, plot two additional images (other than either of the two given in the example script) and include the graph of their predicted label as well as the image itself.*
4. *Under the Use the trained model section, again select a new image from the test dataset. Produce the predictions for this newly selected image.* 
      a) *Does the predicted value match the test label?*
      b) *Although you applied the argmax() function in this second instance, you did not use Softmax() a second time. Why is that so (please be specific)?*
